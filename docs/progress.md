# BTerminal v2 — Progress Log

## Session: 2026-03-05

### Research Phase (complete)
- [x] Analyzed current BTerminal v1 codebase (2092 lines Python, GTK3+VTE)
- [x] Queried Memora — no existing BTerminal memories
- [x] Researched Claude Agent SDK — found structured streaming, subagent tracking, hooks
- [x] Researched Tauri + xterm.js ecosystem — found 4+ working projects
- [x] Researched terminal latency benchmarks — xterm.js acceptable for AI output
- [x] Researched 32:9 ultrawide layout patterns
- [x] Evaluated GTK4 vs Tauri vs pure Rust — Tauri wins for this use case
- [x] Created task_plan.md with 8 phases
- [x] Created findings.md with 7 research areas

### Technology Decision (complete)
- Decision: **Tauri 2.x + Solid.js + Claude Agent SDK + xterm.js**
- Rationale documented in task_plan.md Phase 0

### Adversarial Review (complete)
- [x] Spawned devil's advocate agent to attack the plan
- [x] Identified 5 fatal/critical issues:
  1. Node.js sidecar requirement unacknowledged
  2. SDK 0.2.x instability — need abstraction layer
  3. Three-tier observation overengineered → simplified to two-tier
  4. Solid.js ecosystem too small → switched to Svelte 5
  5. Missing: packaging, error handling, testing, responsive design
- [x] Revised plan (Rev 2) incorporating all corrections
- [x] Added error handling strategy table
- [x] Added testing strategy table
- [x] Defined MVP boundary (Phases 1-4)
- [x] Added responsive layout requirement (1920px degraded mode)

### Phase 1 Scaffolding (complete)
- [x] Created feature branch `v2-mission-control`
- [x] Initialized Tauri 2.x + Svelte 5 project in `v2/` directory
- [x] Rust backend stubs: main.rs, lib.rs, pty.rs, sidecar.rs, watcher.rs, session.rs
- [x] Svelte frontend: App.svelte with Catppuccin Mocha CSS variables, component stubs
- [x] Node.js sidecar scaffold: agent-runner.ts with NDJSON communication pattern
- [x] Tauri builds and launches (cargo build --release verified)
- [x] Dev scripts: npm run dev, npm run build, npm run tauri dev/build
- [x] 17 operational rules added to `.claude/rules/`
- [x] Project meta files: CLAUDE.md, .claude/CLAUDE.md, TODO.md, CHANGELOG.md
- [x] Documentation structure: docs/README.md, task_plan.md, phases.md, findings.md, progress.md

### Next Steps
- [ ] Begin Phase 2: Terminal Pane + Layout (CSS Grid, xterm.js, PTY)
